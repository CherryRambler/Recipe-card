# 🍳 Frontend Mentor - Recipe Page Solution

![Design preview for the Recipe page coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## 🌟 Overview

This is my solution to the **[Recipe Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/)** on **Frontend Mentor**. The goal of this project is to replicate the design as closely as possible using only **HTML** and **CSS (Flexbox)**. It displays a simple and elegant recipe card for an omelette.
